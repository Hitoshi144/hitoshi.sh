## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: About project

The website is a kind of summary. 
The project only has a front-end part, without a back-end, and the focus is on visuals and interesting presentation. The main feature of the website is a 2D model of Yoisaki Kanade, which has a bubble message system and can respond to clicks on the model.
